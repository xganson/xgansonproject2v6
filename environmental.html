  <div class="environmental-itemc"><h6><br>This is where things get heavy. Ferals kill the environment; a study found that between 1.4 billion and 3.7 billion birds and between 6.9 billion and 20.7 billion wild mammals fall prey to free-ranging cats in the U.S. every year.<p><br> As stated before: cats reproduce very fast which is one of the biggest problems in this equation as they are killing eco-systems.</p></h6></div>
  <div class="environmental-iteme"><h6><br>There's a solution! Trap, neuter, release. Neutering ferals and releasing them will help them and the surrounding species. Though a lot of funding is needed to make this happen, head over to my campaign page!</h6></div>
