  <div class="social-itemb"><h2>Population of Ferals</h2><h6>With the rising population of feral cats come new challenges. However, as they scurry into yards some people have their own way of dealing with them. This includes killing them on sight, which is entirely inhumane. We can fix this and give these cats the justice they deserve with the trap, neuter, release or TNR. Cats wildly reproduce in the wild; to protect them, as well as the surrounding birds and critters is a win-win for everyone. This also helps reduce fleas, disease, and bigger predators (coyotes, etc.). Sadly, not everyone knows of TNR and choose to either ignore the problem or deal with it themselves through unjust ways. </h6></div>
